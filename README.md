Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and solve complex tasks such as classification, regression and generation. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how to build and train a simple neural network in PyTorch.

PyTorch offers two primary methods for building neural networks:

Using nn.Module: To create a custom network, subclass the nn.Module class and define the __init__ and forward functions. The __init__ method sets up the layers and parameters, while the forward function defines how input flows through the network and produces output.
Using nn.Sequential: This container allows you to specify layers in a list. The layers are automatically connected in the order provided.
Implementing Feedforward Neural Network for MNIST using PyTorch
Let's implement a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.
